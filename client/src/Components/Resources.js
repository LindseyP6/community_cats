            <h3>Did you know?</h3>
              <li>There are up to 70 million feral cats in the United States alone. A good reason to spay and neuter your pets! <a href="https://www.mygavet.com/services/blog/50-cat-facts-you-probably-didnt-know">Source</a> </li>
              <li>Most Calico colored cats are female!</li>
              <li>A cat is considered 'calico' when the coat is at least 25%-75% white with orange and black patches.</li>
              <li>Your cat not only rubs their head against you as a sign of affection, but they are also making you as their territory. They use the scent glands they have around their face, the base of their tails, and their paws to do so. <a href="https://www.mygavet.com/services/blog/50-cat-facts-you-probably-didnt-know">Source</a></li>

            <h3>TNR: Trap-Neuter-Return</h3>
              <li>Hundreds of thousands of stray cats live on Brooklyn’s streets. Some are friendly, but others have been on their own too long to go back to living with humans. They live in colonies, surviving as best they can. . . More and more municipalities, including New York, now endorse “Trap, Neuter, Return,” or TNR. Neighborhood volunteers, aided by animal rescue organizations, trap the cats in a colony and have them neutered or spayed. They are then “eartipped” – the tip of one ear removed painlessly – for identification as part of a TNR colony. Young kittens and friendly animals are adopted out. The rest are returned to wherever they were found – often a backyard, building courtyard, park or alleyway. Volunteers “manage” the colony, ensuring that the cats are regularly fed and warm shelters provided. Because they are not reproducing, the colony will eventually reduce naturally.</li>
