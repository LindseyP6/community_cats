              <li><strong>The best available estimate suggests that the population is probably about 32 million - 70 million cats on the streets in the United States, roughly 76% of whom live in urban areas </strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mygavet.com/services/blog/50-cat-facts-you-probably-didnt-know">Source</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.felineresearch.org/fast-facts-about-feral-cats">Source</a></li>
              <li>Most Calico and Tortoiseshell colored cats are female!</li>
              <li>A cat is considered 'calico' when the coat is at least 25%-75% white with orange and black patches.</li>
              <li>Your cat not only rubs their head against you as a sign of affection, but they are also making you as their territory. They use the scent glands they have around their face, the base of their tails, and their paws to do so. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mygavet.com/services/blog/50-cat-facts-you-probably-didnt-know">Source</a></li>
              <li>Cats spend 70% of their lives sleeping</li>

            <h3>TNR: Trap-Neuter-Return</h3>
              <li>Hundreds of thousands of stray cats live on Brooklyn’s streets. Some are friendly, but others have been on their own too long to go back to living with humans. They live in colonies, surviving as best they can. . . </li>
              <li>More and more municipalities, including New York, now endorse “Trap, Neuter, Return,” or TNR.</li> 
              <li>Neighborhood volunteers, aided by animal rescue organizations, trap the cats in a colony and have them neutered or spayed. They are then “eartipped” – the tip of one ear removed painlessly – for identification as part of a TNR colony. The rest are returned to wherever they were found – often a backyard, building courtyard, park or alleyway. </li> 
              <li>Volunteers “manage” the colony, ensuring that the cats are regularly fed and warm shelters provided. Because they are not reproducing, the colony will eventually reduce naturally. <a target="_blank" href="https://brooklynanimalaction.org/faq/spay-neuter-resources/">Source</a></li>

            <h3>Why It's Important to Spay/Neuter Cats!</h3>
            <li>Two unaltered cats can produce roughly 100-5,000 kittens in a span of 7 years (which is a long lifespan for a street cat!) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.felineresearch.org/fast-facts-about-feral-cats">Source</a></li>
            <li>The number of cats and dogs entering US shelters each year is 6-8 million (down from 13 million in 1973) <a target="_blank" href="https://kittencoalition.org/news-events/statistics/">Source</a></li>
            <li>Spaying a female cat, especially before the first heat, helps prevent uterine infections, uterine cancers, and breast cancer. Neutering male cats eliminates the chances of testicular cancer and lowers the risk of prostate problems. Generally, spayed and neutered pets live healthier, longer, and happier lives. <a target="_blank" href="https://weareallaboutcats.com/top-reasons-to-spay-or-neuter-your-cat/#:~:text=Spaying%20a%20female%20cat%2C%20especially,%2C%20longer%2C%20and%20happier%20lives.">Source</a></li>
